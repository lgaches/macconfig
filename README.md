thoughtbot dotfiles
===================

Requirements
------------

Set zsh as your login shell.

    chsh -s /bin/zsh


Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/.gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Dan Croak
      email = dan@thoughtbot.com

Your `~/.zshrc.local` might look like this:

    # load rbenv
    eval "$(rbenv init -)"

    # recommended by brew doctor
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

Your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Bundle 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Bundle 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'

What's in it?
-------------

[git](http://git-scm.com/) configuration:

* Adds a `create-branch` alias to create feature branches.
* Adds a `delete-branch` alias to delete feature branches.
* Adds a `merge-branch` alias to merge feature branches into master.
* Adds an `up` alias to fetch and rebase `origin/master` into the feature
  branch. Use `git up -i` for interactive rebases.

Shell aliases and scripts:

* `b` for `bundle`.
* `g` with no arguments is `git status` and with arguments acts like `git`.
* `git-churn` to show churn for the files changed in the branch.
* `m` for `rake db:migrate && rake db:rollback && rake db:migrate && rake db:test:prepare`.
* `mcd` to make a directory and change into it.
* `rake` is `zeus rake` if using [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) on the
  project in current directory.
* `replace foo bar **/*.rb` to find and replace within a given list of files.
* `rk` for `rake`.
* `rspec` is `zeus rspec` if using Zeus on the project in current directory.
* `tat` to attach to tmux session named the same as the current directory.
